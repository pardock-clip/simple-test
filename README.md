# BACKEND SKILLS ASSESSMENT PROJECT
For this task you will be creating a Java application that can be run from the command line.  Thisapplication will take various input parameters and store data about transactions.  The application shouldprocess the parameters and then exit.

The application should store data on the file system under the folder where the application is.  Themethods on the interface for the code that is in charge of storing the data should be written such thatthe code calling the interface should not  have to be changed if you later changed the data storageimplementation so that  data is stored in a database.

Please be prepared to explain what kind of database you would use if you were to store the data in adatabase in the future.  Be prepared to describe the tables and columns you would use (if you were tochoose a relational database), or the collections you would use (if you were to choose a NoSQLdatabase).

Your command line should be able to handle the following command line inputs.

## ADD TRANSACTION
./application <user_id> add <transaction_json>

This command should add a transaction to the user specified in <user_id> using the information specified intransaction_json.  The transaction json will have the following format:
{ “amount”: 1.23, “description”: “Joes Tacos”, “date”:”2018-12-30”, “user_id”: 345 }

This command should print out a version of the transaction added with a unique id for the transaction likethis:
{ “transaction_id”: “2299ce24-9eaf-417f-82d6-e57f93777dc4”, “amount”: 1.23, “description”: “Joes Tacos”,“date”:”2018-12-30”, “user_id”: 345 }

## SHOW TRANSACTION
./application <user_id> <transaction_id>

This command should return the transaction specified in the transaction_id. 

If the user_id is not the user_idthat corresponds with the user_id for the specified transaction,  you should print outTransaction not found If the transaction does exists, you should print out the information for the transaction like this:
{ “transaction_id”: “2299ce24-9eaf-417f-82d6-e57f93777dc4”, “amount”: 1.23, “description”: “Joes Tacos”,“date”:”2018-12-30”, “user_id”: 345 }

## LIST TRANSACTIONS
./application <user_id> list

This command should print  all the transactions associated with the user specified by user_id. Thetransactions should be in chronological order. 

If the user_id does not exist, then the response should returnan empty list. You should print the items in the following format:

[{ “transaction_id”: “2299ce24-9eaf-417f-82d6-e57f93777dc4”, “amount”: 1.23, “description”: “Joes Tacos”,“date”:”2018-12-30”, “user_id”: 345 },{ “transaction_id”: “5467ce24-9eaf-417f-82d6-e57f4444444”, “amount”: 5.26, “description”: “Freds’s Tacos”,“date”:”2018-12-19”, “user_id”: 345 }]

## SUM TRANSACTIONS
./application <user_id> sum

This command should sum all the transactions associated with the user specified by user_id. 
It should printout the sum in the following format: 
{ “user_id”: 123, “sum”: 234.76 }

Please write this application in Java. You are free to implement this however you’d like with whateverresources or 3rd party code you’d want. Feel free to ask questions at any time (cesar.alcancio@payclip.com)
